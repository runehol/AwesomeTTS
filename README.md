# AwesomeTTS

AwesomeTTS makes it easy for language-learners and other students to add
speech to their personal [Anki](http://ankisrs.net) card decks.

More information and documentation for using the add-on can be found on its
[website](https://ankiatts.appspot.com). User reviews of the add-on can be
found on its [AnkiWeb add-on page](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/301952613).

This repository holds two interconnected projects:

- [AwesomeTTS add-on code](addon/), which runs within Anki
- [documentation website and some API web services](web/), which run on Google
  App Engine and help users get the most out of the add-on

[GitHub](https://github.com/AwesomeTTS/AwesomeTTS) is the primary and official
host for the repository and its issue/pull trackers, but there are also
mirrors at [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/corpulentcoffee/awesometts) and
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/corpulentcoffee/AwesomeTTS).
