# AwesomeTTS Web

The website provides documentation and help for current and prospective users
of AwesomeTTS, in addition to hosting some limited APIs for use from the
add-on (e.g. update mechanism, VoiceText access).

[Google App Engine](https://developers.google.com/appengine), with its content
delivery network and Python runtime environment, is the platform for the
website, running at [ankiatts.appspot.com](https://ankiatts.appspot.com).
Building and deployment is done with [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com), which is a
task automation tool that runs under [Node.js](http://nodejs.org).
