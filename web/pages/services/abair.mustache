<p><a href="http://www.abair.tcd.ie" rel="external">abair.ie</a> is an online
  text-to-speech synthesizer offering high-quality playback in various Irish
  voices, which originated from a university research project.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>An Internet connection is required to use abair.ie from AwesomeTTS, but no
  special software needs to be installed and it can be used from any operating
  system.</p>

<p>Because abair.ie is a public Internet service, mass generation of MP3s using
  the <a href="/usage/browser">tool in the Card Browser</a> is rate-limited. If
  you would like to tweak this behavior for your installation of AwesomeTTS, go
  to the <a href="/config/mp3s">MP3s configuration tab</a> and look for the
  &ldquo;Download Throttling&rdquo; settings.</p>
