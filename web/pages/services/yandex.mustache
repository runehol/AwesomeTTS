<p><a href="http://translate.yandex.com" rel="external">Yandex.Translate</a>
  is an online text-to-speech service offering high-quality playback in
  Russian and many European languages.

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>An Internet connection is required to use Yandex.Translate from AwesomeTTS,
  but no special software needs to be installed and it can be used from any
  operating system.</p>

<p>Because Yandex.Translate is a public Internet service, mass generation of
  MP3s using the <a href="/usage/browser">tool in the Card Browser</a> is
  rate-limited. If you would like to tweak this behavior for your installation
  of AwesomeTTS, go to the <a href="/config/mp3s">MP3s configuration tab</a>
  and look for the &ldquo;Download Throttling&rdquo; settings.</p>

<h2>Options</h2>

<p>When using Yandex.Translate, the <strong>Quality</strong> level can be
  tweaked as one of the options. However, the difference in file size between
  the two levels is negligible&mdash;and in some cases the &ldquo;low&rdquo;
  quality level is actually larger in file size than the &ldquo;high&rdquo;
  quality level&mdash;so it is recommended that users stick with the
  &ldquo;high&rdquo; setting.</p>
